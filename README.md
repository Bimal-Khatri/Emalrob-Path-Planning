# Emalrob-Path-Planning

The painting robot, MalRob for short, has long been a topic at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. Students have been working on this robot as part of Prof. Jurgen Walterâ€™s lectures since 2019 and are continuously improving it. A group of students works on a specific topic related to the painting robot and then passes the project on to the next group for further improvement. On this part of project, an IMU sensor is utlized to detect the heading angle of robot and keep it on track. In addition to this, a front switch also is designed so that once a robot hits the boundary, it moves backward and starts rotating. After the rotation the robot orients itself, parallel to the boundary and moves forward.
